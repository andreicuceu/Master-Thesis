\section{Cosmological Simulations}
\normalsize

\begin{comment}
Reconstruction methods have to be tested on large N-body simulations run over cosmological scales. 
\end{comment}

\todo[inline]{Introduce simulations and motivate their use. Present the simulations we used and the analysis tools e.g. Pynbody}

\todo[inline]{First density slices here.}

\section{The Power Spectrum}

\todo[inline]{Introduce the power spectrum and motivate its use.}

\todo[inline]{Could put an image with a Power Spectrum and present a few of the features.}

\todo[inline]{This could be moved to the Growth of Structure chapter, depending on how much detail I want to go into there.}

\section{Calculating the Power Spectrum of a Simulation}

\todo[inline]{Talk about how we obtain the power spectrum (GenPk) and give more detail about the interface between Pynbody and GenPk}
